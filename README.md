## About Me
My name is Maploop, and I like creating new things and bringing ideas to life.
I've been interested in development for about 3-4 years (starting from early 2018),
I started my work by learning Minecraft plugin development with the Spigot library
and after about 3 months I made my first ever working plugin the
[Grappling Hook](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/grappling-hook-plugin-1-16-plugin.87186/) plugin.
Which actually got a lot of downloads for a very simple plugin! And that made me continue
doing what I'm currently doing as a job.

Since then, I've had the opportunity to
[Work on the largest Minecraft Java-Edition server in Iran](https://trexmine.com/),
[Work on large-scaled projects with my Dev team of over 10](https://github.com/AtlasNetworkDev),
[Work on a Unity Game as a co-owner with one of my friends](https://github.com/GaMeIsNtOvEr),

and as of now, I'm focusing on maintaining my dev team at
[The Atlas Network](https://discord.com/invite/atlasmc)
and continue to work there as a Lead Developer.

I have also worked on many [open source projects](https://github.com/Maploop/Atlas2FA)
for use by both regular people & developers.

Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
- Java
- Node.js
- Unity
- C#
- Python
